### Hey 👋, I'm Victor _(Hugo)_ Rocha
`{`
#### Brazilian 🇧🇷 dude living in Kraków, Poland 🇵🇱 currently working as Team Lead @ William Hill

Not much to see at my GitHub profile and repos but I'm always here trying to find inspiration to do my job and trying, somehow, to contribute with other people's job. 

  - 🌱 I’m currently (and continuously) learning `C#`, `Docker`, microservices, message brokers and pipelines in general. I'm also getting interested in performance improvements with `.NET` and `C#` in general.
  - 😄 My pronouns are he/him.
  - 🙊 I speak Brazilian-Portuguese, English, also a bit of Spanish and I know a few sentences and words in Polish.
  - 🐤 You can find me on Twitter as [@vichrocha](https://twitter.com/vichrocha) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorrocha93/)
  - ⚡ Some fun facts:
    - I'm a big fan of metroidvania. So much so I have an Alucard (from SotN) tattoo on my left forearm.
    - I'm also a big fan of Tolkien also having two tattoos based on his work.
